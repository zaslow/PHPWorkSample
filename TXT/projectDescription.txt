Membership Application for State Forest Conservation Committee:

This project will service a non-profit organization that preserves and protects the natural and historic resources of a local state forest.
Once created, the application will include a member log-in page, an online member application form, and an online portal for entering payment information.
This will be supported by a database that stores and organizes contact information, membership statuses, and payment information for all organization members.

Significant services provided by the application will be online membership application & renewal, flexible online payment options for existing
and prospective members, and self-maintenance and storage of organization funds and records.

This application will be utilized by a wide range of users interested in forest conservation. It will commonly appeal to elderly, distinguished
members of the community who would like to preserve the region's natural landscapes. It will also commonly appeal to middle-aged parents, who take
advantage of state forest-related activities with their children and family.
